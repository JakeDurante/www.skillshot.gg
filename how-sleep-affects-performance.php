 	  <h1> Sleep and Its Effects on You </h1>
	  
	  <h3> Why sleep is important</h3>
	  
	  <p>With all the talk about mechanics, champions, map awareness, and various other league terms, one of the
	  most neglected aspects for improving at league is simply sleep. It's a general consensus among the scientific community that
	  lack of sleep significantly affects cognitive performance and considering the fact that players are divided among different
	  skill tiers in League of Legends due to mental abilities alsmot exclusively, a healthy mind is very important to winning games and climbing the
	  ranked ladder.<br>
	  
	  <br>League is almost exclusively a mental game. Keeping your mind sharp by getting the necessary amount of sleep each day is crucial to winning
	  more games. After several studies on sleep deprived patients, there were marked reductions in reaction times, decision making, error correction,
	  risk/reward assessment and even memory formation. All of these are very important to finding success in League of Legends.
